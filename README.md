# Auto Clicker XY List for Windows: record mouse clicks into sequence to edit and replay; do random clicks on your PC desktop

Auto Clicker XY List: free mouse clicker for Windows to record/edit/save/replay whole sequences of mouse actions or emulate random clicks on your PC desktop, written in vanilla C++, statically linked, runs on bare Windows, has been developed as a challenge to the old mousetool's orphamielautoclicker project at sourceforge.net since it was abandoned by the former author. The new auto clicker has many superior advantages on the obsolete competitor that is still being downloaded nearly 400000 times per week. Meanwhile Auto Clicker XY List inherits all the orphamielautoclicker's features, adds a lot of brand new kicking functions and can completely replace all the other mouse clickers on your PC desktop. 

Unlike other auto clickers, new application does not depend on msvcrt.dll, Microsoft .Net runtime, third party's DLLs, components, etc. The program runs on any bare Windows PC and can emulate mouse clicks by three different ways:
1. Using current mouse position on your PC desktop screen
2. From a sequence of user-defined mouse coordinates that can be recorded and stored into a file
3. At random points in a bounding rectangle determined automatically on an arbitrary clicking sequence.

Auto Clicker XY List is 100% clean open source project free of Ads, viruses, malware, trojans, etc. Enthusiasts may build the program themselves. Auto Clicker XY List can be used for education purposes without any charge. Rest of people may download Windows binary installer for the latest release from either official Auto Clicker XY List.website, Drobpox or Google Drive for free.
